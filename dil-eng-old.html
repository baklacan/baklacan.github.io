<p>Language learning is hard. But it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>It does seem like a burden. Articles, cases, tenses — rules are confusing and full of exceptions. Foreign words seem alien. It takes forever before you see the first tangible results.</p>
<p>Yet, languages are a wonder.</p>
<p>They're all about people of distant lands. Their adventures, customs, and attitudes. Their past and present. We are amazed by our differences and impressed by how we're still so similar.</p>
<p>But languages are taught as if they have nothing to do with history, culture, or mentality. The material is given as-is without any explanation. Fake dialogues and dull exercises. No discoveries. No excitement. No adventure.</p>
<p>And if you visit the country, you'll realize you can barely speak. You can barely attend to the local codes. You can barely get things done. You'll feel you don't know the language at all.</p>
<p>It seems forgotten that language is a means of communication. You don't really know it until you can reach an understanding with locals and breeze through your local tasks. That is what it means to learn a language.</p>
<p>And learning a language shouldn't be that hard, that long, or that boring. It should be taught through the lens of the native speakers' social culture. It should be as exciting as reading a page-turner.</p>
<p>Introducing XXX, a new line of language guides bringing you the joy of language learning:</p><ul>
<li>The guides consist of fascinating stories about people of distant lands.</li>
<li>Words, grammar rules, and exceptions reveal peculiarities of the history, culture, or way of thinking of native speakers.</li>
<li>Dialogs explain local communication and behavioural practices.</li>
<li>Built-in flashcards help you memorize new knowledge on the fly.</li>
<li>Optional exercises help you develop communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our guides are an exciting read for boring hours in airports and planes. By the time you arrive, you'll be equipped to have a safe and comfortable stay.</p>

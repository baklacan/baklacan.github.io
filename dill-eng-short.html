<p>Language learning is tedious, but it shouldn't be. Languages are fascinating.</p>
<p>They're all about people of distant lands. Their adventures, customs, and attitudes. Their past and present. You'd be amazed by our differences and impressed by how we're still so similar.</p>
<p>But languages are taught as if they have nothing to do with history, culture, or mentality. Everything is given as-is with no explanation. Alien words. Confusing rules. Countless exceptions. You'll get exhausted memorizing.</p>
<p>Studying a language shouldn't be that hard, that long, or that boring. It should be taught through the lens of the native speakers' world. And you should be as excited as if you're reading a page-turner.</p>
<p>It's time to rethink language learning.</p>
<p>Introducing XXX, a new line of language guides bringing you the joy of language learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The guides consist of fascinating stories about people of distant lands.</li>
<li>Words, grammar rules, and exceptions reveal peculiarities of the history, culture, or way of thinking of native speakers.</li>
<li>Dialogs explain local communication and behavioural practices.</li>
<li>Built-in flashcards help you memorize new knowledge on the fly.</li>
<li>Optional exercises help you develop communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our guides are an exciting read for boring hours in airports and planes. By the time you arrive, you'll be equipped to have a safe and comfortable stay.</p>

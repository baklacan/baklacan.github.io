<p>Something went wrong with language learning.</p>
<p>It'd feel great to quickly learn the basics. Get to know the culture and history of the land. Learn your differences in attitudes and conduct. Decide whether you want to dive deeper into the language.</p>
<p>Your trips to the country would be safe and comfortable. You'd easily come to an understanding with the locals and avoid irritating them by breaking their norms. You'd have an idea of how things work there.</p>
<p>But languages are hard and taught as if they have nothing to do with history, traditions, or mentality. History books say little about culture. And you need to try hard to find anything about local communication and behavioral practices.</p>
<p>Learning a language is so hard and insufficient for clear communication that you don't start a new one until it's absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>But what if you could quickly dabble in many languages?</strong></p>
<p>Learning the basics of a language shouldn't be that hard, that long, or that boring. It should be taught through the lens of the native speakers' conduct, customs, and attitudes. And it should be as exciting as reading a page-turner.</p>
<p>Introducing XXX, a series of city & language guides, bringing you the joy of language learning:</p><ul>
<li>The guides consist of fascinating stories about people from distant lands and their adventures.</li>
<li>Words, grammar rules, and exceptions reveal peculiarities of the history, culture, or way of thinking of native speakers.</li>
<li>Dialogs explain local communication and behavioural practices.</li>
<li>Topic guides introduce you to how things work in specific areas, such as medicine, parenting, renting, etc.</li>
<li>Optional flashcards and exercises help you almost automatically memorize and ingrain key elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>With XXX guides, you can quickly explore the basics of many languages, decide which one you want to learn deeper, and choose which country you'd like to visit or even live in.</p>
<p>Our guides are also an exciting read for boring hours in airports and planes. And by the time you arrive, you'll be equipped to have comfortable communication with locals.</p>
